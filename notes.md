# Plot hole?

I'm not sure why Fenix would all of a sudden not be meek anymore, but start elbowing their way to the city limits to get Scratt back. There has to be a good reason for this new behaviour.

Wil it make more sense for Brüli to hire some foes (and recruit some mates) to STOP Fenix from catching up?

Or it can be known that Fenix can't do long journeys, which is why they live close to work and only do a short journey every day, which does push their annoyance level all the way to 99. The last time Fenix did a long journey, they passed out, and woke up in their bed at home. (Yonderfille Health Services has a way to get you back into your own bed, which is a bit creepy, but hey...). So all of a sudden their neko is gone, and they see the message stuck in the letterbox: "I have your neko. If you want them back, come to Faraway-so-Klouse" which is far away.

Just exactly how far away is Faraway-so-Klouse? Brüli only intended to be just outside of the busyness of the city to have a private encounter with Fenix. ~~Or Brüli could go half-way around Planet Earthlike to the Munchie HQ (but for what good reason?), or to meet up with a stranger who's willing to trade a lifetime supply of munchies for a very rare neko (which Scratt is).~~

Faraway-so-Klouse could actually be many train stops outside of Yonderville, in the countryside. It'll be fine if we're restricted to trains, train-like things, maybe buses.

So, here's the wrap: Fenix has to go outside of the usual short journey, and attempt a very long journey indeed, and try not to pass out. Otherwise they have to start at the very beginning.

Can Fenix just give up on Scratt? Nooo, they love each other too much, and it's Fenix's duty to get Scratt back. We can even show a few scenes where Fenix just found out that Scratt is gone, and then contemplates going out or not, knowing the journey will be a killer. But the longer they wait, the weaker they become because they miss their little neko sooo much. "I need you, Scratt!"

# Slap card

Violence is not tolerated on public transport, so at some point the shopkeep sells you a Slap Card, and the first time you use it, you're thrown off the train and escorted home. Do you evict the card, or do you learn that there's a time and a place for the Slap Card? (Perhaps in the final battle?)

(which is what I went with)

> Brüli and Scratt love wursties, and Fenix don't. Brüli learns to like Scratt as the latter frequently pops over for a visit and a wurstie. Scratt, being a neko, easily shifts their loyalties to holder-of-the-wursties Brüli. Brüli wants Scratt for themselves, and they "run away together". Fenix learns of this plan, and is in hot pursuit. Fenix has to overcome their intense dislike of public transport, and travel all the way to where Brüli and Scratt are holed up. Brüli sends friends and acquaintances to slow Fenix down (these will be the battles on public transport which is the core gameplay). In the final showdown, Fenix defeats Brüli, and promises Scratt that there'll be more wursties in the house from now on. OR, since the final showdown isn't on a train, there'll be no need for "train battle" (like elbow bumps and other public transport annoyances), so perhaps Brüli and Scratt are just NOT at the final location, with a "to be continued" message at the end, which leaves a possible avenue for a sequel, or something else altogether.


## Possible story thread 1

> Brüli and Scratt loves wursties, and Fenix is allergic (or doesn't like them for ethical reasons, because wursties is made with the Top Secret Wink-wink Recipe). Brüli kidnaps Scratt to a quiet location and invites Fenix there to pay damages for the missing wursties and get Scratt back. Fenix has to overcome their crippling distaste of public transport and travel all the way to the remote location. The only way Fenix survives on public transport is to "fight back" whenever some incident on public transport drives them bananas (these will be the battles on public transport which is the core gameplay).

Even though Scratt only has one wurstie every day from Brüli's plentiful supply, Brüli does notice, and gets mad.

Then one day Brüli hides in the wardrobe. Scratt pops in unawares, and gets up on the countertop to get to the wursties jar. Ah-ha! Brüli jumps out of the cupboard and snatches Scratt, stuffs a sock in their mouth, ties them up, and stuffs them into a gym bag.

The city is too busy, Brüli thinks. I'll have to lure Fenix out of Yonderville, and face off somewhere where no-one can see or hear us. "Today is the day that Fenix pays me back for all those wursties", they think.

Fenix comes home to a letter on the floor by the front door, and no Scratt. The messages reads "I've got your neko. Come to Faraway-so-Klouse".  Fenix's heart sinks - that place is in the country, and they hate public transport, and can literally/physically not stand it.

In fact, they dislike it so much, and even contemplates not pursuinig Scratt, knowing the journey will be a killer. But the longer they wait, the weaker they become because they miss their little neko sooo much. "I need you, Scratt!" and Fenix finally musters enough courage, buys the train ticket, and boards the train.

## Mood

As an alternative to finding an empty location in Faraway-so-Klouse at the end:

> OR Fenix might just have caught up with Brüli and Scratt, and fight Brüli on a final train. Which means Brüli's original message won't be "meet at Farraway-so-Klouse" but rather Fenix somehow figures out where Brüli is heading, and heads there themselves. Fenix could find a printed receipt for a train ticket in Brüli's flat (after going up the firestairs themselves and breaking in through the open window) and the foes Fenix will enounter will be foreshadowed with a big photograph of Brüli and all their university friends, who will be the same friends Fenix fights on their journey.
