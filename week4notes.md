# notes:

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Evaluate the potential of different genres of story to support gameplay.
- Plan the use of storytelling methods, such as cut-scenes, dialogue and environmental storytelling.
- Create characters in response to archetypes and gameplay roles.
- Reflect on the implications of nonlinearity and interactivity for storytelling.

Storytelling with:
- images (e.g. swapping dungeon with spaceship)
- cutscenes

closure (undersyanding comics)
mis en scene (and other filmmaking concepts)
book: film directing: shot by shot (katz)

- narration (omniscient, chatty protagonist, notes, diary entries, audio logs)

Show, don't tell. Show the crater, instead of "a bomb fell here 5 years ago".

- dialogue

or silent protagonist

- FMV full motion video
- sound, music
- game mechanics

ludo-narrative dissonance: when a game mechanic is at odds with the narrative. E.g. GTA protagonist showing remorse, when the player actually had loads of fun running everyone down in the streets.

--

characters -> personality (OCEAN), arcs, mental state, relationships and social networks, occupation/role. appearance/diversity
setting -> dungeon/spaceship, utopia/dystopia (or is this theme?)
genre/theme -> horror, western, detective, etc

all drama is conflict (romantic, political, war, social, etc)

plot -> 
structure -> 3 act, hero's journey (a hero with a thousand faces (book)), story circle (dan harmon)




# choose theme

4 questions:
- is your theme something you're into?
- does your theme support the game mechanics?
- does your theme communicate the goal? (is saving a cat enough?)
- does your theme have both familiarity and novelty? (the commute is familiar, but what is novel about the game?)

# fantasy

play/theme
play: mechanic/systems
theme: art, sound
+fantasy = you're living the theme

1. understand the fantasy
2. art/narrative/sound reinforce the theme
3. create mechanics which is congruous with the fantasy

study both the winners and the losers.

Dune = arthurian love story + interstellar travel + speculative biology
Combine all your themes and let the Venn diagram show you the sweet spot.

# interactive narrative

by Ch√© Wilbraham 

Create a story WORLD, not a story LINE.
Plot is events, not rules.
Player should be able to make lots of (dramatically) interesting decisions. Choices should be roughly equally likely/believable and interesting (could go either way).

Story WORLD: possibility space designed fr the player
Story LINE: one possible play-through of the world.

Story chunks: choices, actions, events. Scenes, paragraphs, comic panels.

2 modes of experiencing interactive narrative:
- embedded narrative
- emergent narrative

embedded: pre-generated, crafted (authored), e.g. cutscenes, backstory, scripted events
emergent: arises from rules, created by player through play, e.g. moment-to-moment gameplay, victory/defeat, unusual interactions

Styles/types of interactive narratives:
- branching narrative: requires lots of authoring of content, some of which might not be seen
- linear "interactive": cutscenes + playable sections interspersed.
- sandbox: (contrasts linear), very emergent, highly interactive, little predetermined plot (can feel directionless)
- autonomous agents (not a style as such): NPCs
- drama managers (not a style as such): AI directors in games, game masters in pen+paper games.

# ergodic literature

(yikes, skipping for now)

# morality (mark brown)

throws away karma systems, and make morality a game mechanic.
e.g. darkest dungeon, this war of mine, papers please.

# telling stories with systems (mark brown)

Games that tout themselves as having stories or branching narratives often fail to deliver, and feel bland. Then there are games that don't, but you end up creating great stories yourself (e.g. Civ)

This video shows the Nemesis system (shadow of mordor) which was patented.
