# Introduction

As mentioned before, Contumacious Commuter is inspired by deck-building and card games like Slay The Spire and Monster Train.

For the record, this version of the level design document will be very rough-and-ready. I just didn't have time to iterate on designs, or read (much) around the subject this week, and I'm drawing from previous experience and stuff I've read before.

# Battle arenas

The battle arenas are the interiors of public transport (only trains at the time of writing). Characters may be standing or seated. The train will be moving, and this is evident by the parallax scrolling over the outside world through the windows. The straphangers might sway to and fro to indicate the swaying of the train's mass.

The interiors will be hand-rendered illustration using monochrome colour schemes (black line on white background), with accent colours (perhaps only on characters). 

These interiors will be fairly standard train interiors, and will have slight variety from one level to the next, e.g. different levels of wear, different patterns on the seating, different fellow commuters (onlookers), etc.

# Merchant

The merchant will be encountered on the platform at train stations. Again, rendered monochrome, with accent. The only playable interaction is the selection of goods, and upon clicking, money is deducted from your purse/wallet.
