# Intro

To fit with the illustrated theme and quirky other-worldly setting, I thought perhaps a jazzy soundtrack might be a good accompaniment (pun intended). I've never done jazz, so that's a whole new fun thing to explore.

The SFX are detailed in a sheet below.

# All required SFX

There are many different attack types, spanning from direct contact to environment attacks, but it would take ages to record them all. (And I think some of them might not even have an audio equivalent, e.g. "smelly food" card.)

I've instead chosen to limit the SFX to a few basic sounds. In keeping with the scope, there's a single protagonist and a single antagonist, and each will have a basic SFX for giving and taking punishment, and variety for all SFX can be introduced with the game engine's [built-in pitch randomiser](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_audiostreamrandompitch.html).
