##Â aesthetics
- AVOID NAIVETY and don't do the first thing that comes to mind.
- study art history: 
We should make art direction decisions based on observation of the real world and knowledge of art history, as well as research into the target market for our game, its potential audience and its competitor products.
- use references
- minimalism/maximalism
- materials/textures
- skeuomorphism

## readability
- icons
- study art history: Research into art and design history can help you find inspiration for props, environments, costumes, creatures and characters that tread the line between familiarity and uniqueness.
- visual consistency: clour, scale
- avoid ambiguity
- uniqueness
- iterate your designs (form follows function)
- simple is relatable

## colour
- sky blue, clouds white, trees green: but it doesn't need to be this simple (golden/magic hour: sunrise/sunset)
- hsv, less saturtion = subtle, value = brightness
- colour script: how hues/values change between scenes

Riot Games ep1 - intro to game art

game artists role:

- clarity: relate critical information
- satisfaction: clear/responsive feedback on player actions
- style: colour, characters, proportions, that sets an emotional tone

visual hierarchy (most important information is easiest to see)
- value contrast
- shape & size contrast
- detail placement
- i.e. create areas of focus (shape, colour, saturation, size, layout, position)

Riot Games ep2 - concept art

concept art = visual problem solving

## project prep

- understand the problem
- set constraints, narrow focus
- research (mood board, gut check)

## generating ideas

- drawing for ideation (two-tone approach, draw simply)
- closing doors (brainstorming from broad to narrow, e.g. animals -> dog, dogs -> bulldog -> bulldogs -> the scary red one)

## navigating feedback

- specific feedback, e.g. not "which do you like" but "which is scariest?"
- no grand reveals. Present early and often
- care about your work! You're inspiring the team.

Riot Games ep3 - character art

## concept to 3D

capture the fantasy and iconic elements of the character, and preserve the iconic traits during the concept process. (e.g. a character's shoulder pads and scarf might be the focal points, and these are what's visible even if the character is tiny)

## 3D modelling process

- proxy model: big blocks of shapes and colour (be able to make changes quickly)
- high poly sculpt
- low poly mesh (reduce down the triangles)
- create a UV map (unwrapping the model)
- texture baking

## surfaces

- texture painting (painting the unwrapped texture area)
- shaders

PS learn anatomy, and be able to create believable weird characters

Roman Dlapa - character design (unintelligible mostly; transscript also buggy)

- start with a shape
- make a silhouette and black it out
- find secondary shapes using gray/white (where just drawing with value here)
- choose palette 2-3 colours, maybe up to 5
- apply colour
- think about further detail, shading and texture
- think about proportion, esp. w.r.t. animation (8 heads tall, etc)
- put the character in an environment, see how the character reads

Moth city creator - 4 tips for character design

- start with silhouette
- shape (and internal shapes) "give the character 'shape themes'"
- tone; tonal contrast (5 tones - white to black; nail down the values for highlights/features, like e.g. badge on sherrif's shirt, buttons on a coat, scarf hanging down)
- placement (proportion), eyes, ears, relation to each other / where on the face

Albert Lozano (art director Pixar)

- appeal, relateability  (in foes, something you dislike)
- shapes can convey emotions, e.g. square/angry, happy/star, nervous/question_mark, sad/round, feisty/triangle

colour theory (alcwyn)

joseph albers urges us to "think in siutuation" and not just take the values we get from colour wheels (e.g. adobe kolor) as authoritative. Colours change depending on the context and their neighbours. We should experiment.

Any colour works with any other colour, given the right quantities.

Just watch the video. So much stuff.

## Frame

- when and where is the game set

## Form

- The style of the game
- shapes, e.g. lots of angular graphics (Guacamelee!)
- colours, e.g. limited palette
- is it proportionally realistic, simplified?

## Focus

- the visual idea that you're doing better than other people
- e.g. detail, lighting, 1000 things moving on screen, fluid animation, open world exploration
- e.g. Shadow Of Collossus = emphasis on scale.
- e.g. Guacamelee! living/dead world (and resulting colour palette swap)

## Filter

- art direction is a lens throug which all of your games visuals are realised,
- and a filter is similar to that, but more specific, almost like your art's "secret sauce"
- e.g. your game looks like it's painted by Van Gogh.
- e.g. your game looks like it's playing on 80s CRT + VHS
- or a technical limitation, e.g. pixel art at 320x200 pixels
- e.g. Fallout 3: 1950s americana (also quite humourous, which provides some relief from an otherwise bleak game)
- e.g. Guacamelee! "Day of the Dead" and wrestling (which is not only how you battle, but bossfights are introduced as wrestling matches with "A VS B" posters)


## other

- make lists of stuff, e.g. write down 10 keywords
- make mood boards, but only a couple, and each only about 10 pics: you have to be selective
- research multiple levels deep (e.g. Russian dolls are based on lacquer box painting, which predates it, and then the style of painting on those boxes can be used as your art style, so it all ties together)
- concept art is about ideas, and design, and not about illustration.

Riot Games ep4 - environment art

## process

- prioritise the most important stuff
- start with concept art
- use grey-block prototype and decide where important things are, like obstacles, where enemies appear, etc
- then do a first art pass, and playtest
- then polish

## solving for game constraints

- environments have to 
- 1. feel like a real place
- 2. communicate what's happening
- e.g. a rocky cliff is a barrier to somewhere, but has clear ledges which shows it can be scaled.

## visual hierarchy

- layout and composition: shapes lead the eye, just like an image. 
- lighting: beauty _ believability; focal points; establish mood; contrast (spotlighting + shadows); lead the player
- level of detals: focal points, e.g. shifting from areas of rest to areas of detail

## believability

- storytelling: everything from layout to individual props tell the story, e.g. climate/age/culture, e.g. remnants of food and laundry hanging out to dry = someone was/is here
- research: take photos of everything; collect references; buy books with lots of photos in them

## efficiency

low polycount; re-use models; techniques for saving memory when objects are far away and don't need much detail; 
- modular kits: build pieces of the world in re-usable chunks; e.g. rocks/crates that can just be rotated to look different

When people give you feedback, they might be giving you a solution, instead of trying to explain the problem. Try and understand the problem first.
